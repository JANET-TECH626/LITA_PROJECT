# LITA_CLASS_PROJECT
This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with The Incubator Hub

### PROJECT TITLE: E-COMMERCE SALES ANALYSIS

[PROJECT OVERVIEW](project-overview)
---
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the performance of the E-Commerce Project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight into making reasonable decisions which then enables us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from the data.
 
### DATA SOURCES

### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATIONS
---
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
---
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which product are top sellers?
- What are the product on peak sales?

### DATA ANALYSIS
---
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some the DAX expressions used during your analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
